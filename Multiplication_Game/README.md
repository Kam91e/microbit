# Micro:bit Multiplication Game

This project is a simple multiplication game for the BBC micro:bit, where players input the product of two random numbers generated by the device. The player interacts with the buttons, accelerometer, and logo touch sensor to provide their answer. The game uses visual feedback to indicate whether the answer is correct or not.

## Features

- **Random Multiplication Problems**: The program generates two random numbers between 1 and 10. The task is to find their product.
- **User Input**: The player provides their answer by pressing button A to adjust the tens digit and button B to adjust the ones digit.
- **Answer Confirmation**: Tilt the micro:bit upwards (gesture 'up') to confirm the entered value.
- **End Game**: Touch the logo on the micro:bit to submit the answer and finish the current round.
- **Feedback**: The game displays a happy face if the answer is correct and a sad face if it's incorrect. The correct answer is then shown.
  
## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Press button A to start a new round. Two random numbers will appear on the screen along with the multiplication sign (`*`).
2. **Adjust Your Guess**:
   - Press button A to increment the tens digit.
   - Press button B to increment the ones digit.
3. **Confirm the Answer**: Once you've entered your answer, tilt the micro:bit upwards (logo facing up) to display your input.
4. **Submit the Answer**: Touch the micro:bit's logo to submit your answer and finish the round.
5. **Check the Result**:
   - If correct, the micro:bit will show a happy face, followed by the correct result.
   - If incorrect, a sad face will appear, and the correct result will be displayed, followed by the value you entered.

## Installation

1. Install the [Micro:bit Python Editor](https://python.microbit.org/).
2. Copy the code provided in `main.py` into the editor.
3. Connect your BBC micro:bit via USB and flash the code onto the device.

## Code Explanation

- **Random Number Generation**: The numbers for the multiplication problem are randomly generated using `randint(1, 10)`.
- **Input Handling**: The `button_a` and `button_b` are used to set the player's guess for the tens and ones digits respectively. The player can increment each digit by pressing the corresponding button.
- **Checking the Answer**: When the player tilts the micro:bit upwards, the current input value is displayed. Touching the logo submits the answer for checking.
- **Game Feedback**: A happy or sad face is displayed based on the correctness of the player's input.

## Future Improvements

- **Scoring System**: Add a score counter to track how many correct answers the player gets in a row or overall.
- **Time Limit**: Implement a countdown timer for each round, adding a time challenge for the player.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Allow the player to choose between different difficulty levels (e.g., easy for single-digit multiplication, harder for two-digit numbers).
- **Sound Feedback**: Add sound effects to enhance user feedback, such as a sound for a correct or incorrect answer.

## Requirements

- BBC Micro:bit
- Python Editor or any suitable environment for running Micro:bit Python code.
